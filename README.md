# Website Integration

## Step 1
Create a HTML form with the fields you want the user to fill and don't forget to add name attribute to the input fields and a submit button.
```
<form>
  <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

## Step 2
Add method attribute as "post" and action attribute as "https://api.formclip.xyz/form/{accesskey}" of the form.
```
<form action="https://api.formclip.xyz/form/accesskey" method="post">
```
That's all you are done with the integration. Whenever someone submits the form you will receive the response in your inbox.
